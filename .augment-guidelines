## Startup Chat Rules

- Read @DESCRIPTION.md at chat start; this is the detailed documentation for creating the application.
- Read @README.md at chat start; this is the application description for users.
- Follow everywhere "Basic Goal" from [DESCRIPTION.md](mdc:DESCRIPTION.md)
- Mark DONE items in @TODO.md as done after they are implemented.
- Update README.md and DESCRIPTION.md with new implementations.
- Change relevant tests if changing logic.
- Don’t use `cd` in commands; run everything from the project root!!!
- Do not add comments about what you’re doing, such as moving code or similar actions. That won’t be true in the next step, and no one cares. Comments should only describe the functionality that exists, not the steps you took to program it.
- After code changes, always run tests at the end `mise run test`
- Without functional unit tests, you cannot work on end-to-end tests.
- Don't make anything up, if you don't know, read the DESCRIPTION.md again and follow the "Basic Goal" at all times.
