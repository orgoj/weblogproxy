## Docker Best Practices
- Ensure entrypoint.sh correctly handles binary paths in the container.
- Check Dockerfile paths for application startup.
- After Docker changes, always run `mise run docker-test`.
- For binaries, set paths relative to WORKDIR.
- Set and pass UID/GID correctly for container runtime.
- Place binaries in /usr/local/bin to follow standards.
- Test Docker changes with different UID/GID and mounted volumes.
