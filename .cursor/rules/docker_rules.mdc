## Docker Best Practices
- Ensure the entrypoint.sh script correctly handles the path to binary files in the container.
- Check the correctness of paths in the Dockerfile for application startup.
- After Docker file changes, always run `mise run docker-test` to verify functionality.
- For binary applications in Docker, correctly set paths relative to WORKDIR.
- Ensure correct setting and passing of UID/GID for container runtime.
- Binary files should be in /usr/local/bin for following standard conventions.
- Test Docker changes with different parameters (UID/GID, mounted volumes).
