# ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Git Commit Rules
- Add every new configuration option (with a comment) to [config/example.yaml](mdc:config/example.yaml).
- For tests, always follow [test_update_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/test_update_rules.mdc).
- Fix all errors and warnings, rerun tests until all pass.
- When a task is complete:
  1. REMOVE completed items from `TODO.md` (do not just mark them as [x])
  2. ADD a corresponding entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (Added/Changed/Fixed)
  3. If relevant to users, update `README.md`.
  4. Update documentation in all relevant `.md` files.
- Commit all changes in English:
  ```bash
  git add . ; git commit -m "Short summary (max 100 chars)" -m "Detailed description of changes"
  ```
- Describe what you did in the chat and wait for the next task.
