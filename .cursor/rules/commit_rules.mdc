# ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Always Follow These Rules for Git Commit
- Run all tests as defined in `mise.toml`: `mise test`, `mise security-check`, `mise docker-test`
- If there are any errors or warnings, fix them and re-run the tests until everything passes automatically
- Once everything is resolved, continue with the following steps:
- Move completed items from `TODO.md` to `CHANGELOG.md`
- If the change is relevant to the user, also update `README.md`
- Update project documentation in **all** relevant `.md` files
- Commit all changes:  
  ```bash
  git add .  
  git commit -m "Short summary of changes (max 100 characters)

  Detailed description of what was changed"
  ```
- Describe what you did in the chat, and wait for the next task
