# ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Follow These Rules Before Doing Any TODO Task
- Read the first block of tasks
- Identify related tasks that can be done simultaneously
- Mark tasks you are working on with `[-]`
- Read [DESCRIPTION.md](mdc:DESCRIPTION.md) for general application concept
- Perform a code analysis to determine how to resolve the tasks
- Find the latest information and procedures available online
- Propose solutions with multiple options, write them to the user, and wait for approval to proceed
- Process user feedback (if any) and repeat the previous step
- If you have a work order, start implementation following the approved procedure
- Work automatically, simply, and cleanly, as a professional senior developer
- When a task is complete:
  1. First, mark it as done with `[x]` in TODO.md
  2. Add corresponding entries to CHANGELOG.md
  3. REMOVE the completed tasks entirely from TODO.md (don't just mark them as [x])
  4. Follow `@commit_rules.mdc` for the commit process
